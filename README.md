# Toolbox

## Description
Toolbox is a renter marketplace, where you can list tools for rent, and rent from other users.
You can start by searching for the tool(s) you need by all tools, or by category.

Tools may have multiple listings - when you find the one you want, add it to your cart!
Once you're finished, go to your cart and checkout. 

## Motivation
We wanted to createa a simple renting marketplace for tools. The idea is that sometimes we need specialized tools for short-term jobs/projects that don't justify a purchase and renting the tool for a day would be a much preferred alternative.
