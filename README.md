# Toolbox
Welcome to Toolbox - a fullstack Ruby on Rails app

## Description
Toolbox is a renter-lender marketplace, where you can list tools for rent, and rent from other users.
You can start by searching for the tool(s) you need by all tools, or by category.

Tools may have multiple listings - when you find the one you want, add it to your cart!
Once you're finished, go to your cart and checkout. 

Pretend there's a checkout form, and our partners will have your tool(s) delivered to you in no time!
(unfortunately, we have yet to build out the rent and return functionality, so just use your imagination)
